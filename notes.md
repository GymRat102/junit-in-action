- one aspect of the point of automate test ---> test saves programmer of the action of typing the input
- Java way of testing still need programmer to monitor the console output
- seperate test case, make main method easier to maintain
- skeleton code benefits you to run test and manage result
- understanding unit test framework:
  - each unit test should run independently of all other unit test
    - Junit supports using a different class instance and class loader instance for each test
  - the framework should detect and report errors test by test
    - Junit reports all errors test by test
  - It should be easy to define which unit test will run
    - add corresponding try/catch blocks to `main` is hard to manage 
    - registration procedure / reflection to potentially solve adding new test problem
    - Junit support discovering methods
